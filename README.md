
# Intelligent Review Analyzer

A machine learning and data mining-based project that analyzes user reviews using natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment classification techniques. This tool can help identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments from textual data such as product or service reviews.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses a dataset named **`reviews.csv`**, which should be placed in the project directory. This file contains user-written reviews and may include corresponding metadata.

### Expected Columns:
- `ReviewText`: The text content of the user review
- `Rating`: A score (e.g., 1 to 5 stars)
- `Sentiment`: (Optional) Label indicating sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

**Note:** You can use your own review dataset as long as it follows a similar structure.

## 🎯 Features

- Clean and preprocess textual review data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Extract features using TF-IDF or bag-of-words
- Train models such as Naive Bayes or SVM for sentiment classification
- Visualize sentiment distribution through graphs
- Display common keywords for positive and negative reviews
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (v3.7+)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
